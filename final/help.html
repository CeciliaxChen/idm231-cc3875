                        ATLA was a Nickelodeon show that was my entire childhood. It was actually the show that inspired me to pursue art and be in the major I am in now. It holds a special place in my heart. The different characters within ATLA (and some characters from the sequel "The Legend of Korra") correspond to the western astrological Zodiac signs. I hope these character and character descriptions resonate with you as much as they do with me!
