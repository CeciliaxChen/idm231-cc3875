                ATLA stands for Avatar: The Last Airbender 
                <br>
                It was a Nickelodeon show that was my entire childhood. It was actually the show that inspired me to pursue art and be in the major I am in now. 
                It holds a special place in my heart. The different characters within ATLA (and some characters from the sequel "The Legend of Korra") correspond to the western astrological Zodiac signs.

                Enter your birthday using the calendar input, with numbers filling two digits per input section of month and date, and 4 digits for the year. 
                Once you fill in your birthday, you can click "BOOM!" 
                <br>
                I hope these character and character descriptions resonate with you as much as they do with me!
